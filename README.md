During offline study, I was requested to create a NodeJS Volunteer Code Guide. 

This publication is solely created by me and can be used as a technical solution for implementations, that include:
- NodeJS + SFCC & SFRA Data Exports,
- NodeJS + SFCC & SFRA Campaign synchronization for data (update, addNew, getSaved, delete, run),
- NodeJS + Salesforce SDK for Node.js Functions, and
- NodeJS + SFMC Email template.
